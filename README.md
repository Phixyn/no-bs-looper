# No Bullshit YouTube Looper

I'm sick of all this adware bs loopers jfc I'll just make my own.

Update at 1:25AM: Damn, that was way too easy, no wonder people use this to make a quick dirty buck out of adware.

## Use

~~Just build and run the damn Docker container and access the page from any device on your network.  ~~
~~Docker does come with some bullshit and so does setting up Nginx, so I'll deploy a full no bullshit easy to use page that anyone can access soon(tm).~~

Needs updating with instructions on how to set up and run the backend server :confounded:

## License

TL;DR: No bullshit license. Use it anyway you want, modify the code anyway you want, but do share it (in the spirit of open source and no bullshit software).
